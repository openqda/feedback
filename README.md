  - → https://github.com/orgs/openqda/discussions/categories/ideas

  - → https://github.com/orgs/openqda/discussions/categories/q-a
- I have a technical issue
  - I'm sure it's a bug and it's reproducible →https://github.com/orgs/openqda/discussions/categories/general
  - I'm not sure → https://github.com/openqda/feedback/issues
